= Adding an integration test

You can add an integration test to ensure that individual components correctly integrate to form a whole application. {ProductName} runs integration tests on the container images of components before it deploys those images.     

.Prerequisites

* You have created an application in {ProductName}.

.Procedure
Complete the following steps in the {ProductName} console:

. Open an existing application and go to the *Integration tests* tab.
. Select *Add integration test*.
. In the *Integration test name* field, enter a name of your choosing.
. In the *GitHub URL* field, enter the URL of the GitHub repository that contains the test you want to use.
. Optional: If you want to use a branch, commit, or version other than the default, specify the branch name, commit SHA, or tag in the *Revisions* field
. In the *Path in repository* field, enter the path to the `.yaml` file that defines the test you want to use.
. Optional: If you do not want the test to prevent the application from being deployed, then select *Mark as optional for release*. 
. Select *Add integration test*.
. Start a new build for any component you want to test.
.. For components using the default build pipeline, go to the *Components* tab, select the three dots next to the name of the component, and select *Start new build*.
.. For components with an upgraded build pipeline, make a commit to their GitHub repository.

.Params added by integration-service automatically to the integration PipelineRun
.. A param containing the Snapshot as a json string
.. A param containing the DeploymentTarget connection details and Environment name

.Labels added by integration-service automatically to the integration PipelineRun
.. The type of the PipelineRun, i.e. "test"
.. Optional flag of the IntegrationTestScenario
.. The name of both application , component and IntegrationTestScenario

.Verification
When the new build is finished:

. Go to the *Integration tests* tab and select the highlighted name of your test.
. Go to the *Pipeline runs* tab of that test and select the most recent run.
.  On the *Details* page, you can see if the test succeeded for that component. Navigate to the other tabs for more details.
